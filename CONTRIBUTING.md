# Contributing

Thanks for improving OpenSquilla. Keep pull requests small, focused, and covered by tests that outside contributors can run without private access.

## Target Branch

Open pull requests against `dev` by default. OpenSquilla uses `dev` as the active integration branch for feature work, bug fixes, tests, and contributor changes.

Use `main` only for maintainer-directed release candidates, release stabilization, documentation-only preview, or urgent hotfix work that starts from the current published line. When in doubt, target `dev`; maintainers will route release-ready changes from `dev` to `main`. If a pull request was opened against `main` by mistake, retarget it to `dev` before review.

After a release, maintainers may start a new development cycle from the
latest `main` release point. When that requires replacing the active
`dev` branch, the previous branch will be archived and contributors
will be asked to rebase or retarget open pull requests.

## Linked Issues

Declare issue relationships in pull request descriptions with GitHub keywords:

- Use `Fixes #123`, `Closes #123`, or `Resolves #123` when the pull request is intended to fix the issue.
- Use `Refs #123` when the pull request is related but should not move the issue toward closure.
- Use `None` when no public issue is linked.

OpenSquilla keeps issue closure tied to the release branch. Merging a fixing
pull request into `dev` marks the issue as `merged-to-dev` and
`needs-verification`; the issue remains open until the fix reaches the default
branch through a release or hotfix pull request. Maintainers may use
`has-linked-pr` while work is still under review. If a linked pull request is
closed without merging, the automation removes `has-linked-pr`.

## Attribution On Squash Or Replay

When maintainer cleanup, replay, or squash merging collapses contributor
commits, keep the final non-empty commit attributable with `Co-authored-by:`
trailers for every human contributor whose work is included. Preserve pull
request author attribution and commit author attribution separately when they
differ.

## Default Checks

Install development dependencies:

```powershell
uv sync --extra dev --extra recommended
```

Run the public quality gate before opening a pull request:

```powershell
uv run ruff check src tests
uv run pytest -q
uv build --wheel
```

Default tests must be offline, deterministic, credential-free, and safe for forks. Do not add network, provider, browser, or channel requirements to the default pull request path.

## Test Expectations

Add or update public regression tests for behavior changes and bug fixes. Prefer focused unit or integration tests unless the behavior crosses the gateway, browser UI, provider, or channel boundary.

Live checks are maintainer-only gates. The `Live Release E2E` workflow covers real provider, browser, and optional channel smoke tests with GitHub secrets and explicit opt-in inputs.

## Private Materials

Private test suites, release red-team prompts, real provider transcripts, real channel identifiers, local paths, credentials, and AI session artifacts must not be committed.

Local maintainer-only files may live under `tests/_private/` or `.omx/private-golden/`; both are excluded from the public tree and default pytest collection.

## Third-Party Origins

Declare any third-party origin in the pull request. If no third-party material is
involved, say `none`. If there is any uncertainty, use the more conservative
category and let maintainers narrow it during review.

- `inspired-by`: only the idea influenced the change; no code, rules, fixtures,
  structure, or copied text is reused.
- `adapted/ported`: OpenSquilla re-expresses upstream behavior, rules, or
  structure in OpenSquilla code.
- `vendored`: upstream source is copied into the repository with minimal or no
  changes.
- `direct dependency`: OpenSquilla depends on an external package through
  `pyproject.toml` or another package manager.
- `modified upstream`: vendored upstream source is patched or otherwise changed
  in the OpenSquilla tree.

For `adapted/ported`, `vendored`, and `modified upstream` material, include the
upstream URL, license, copyright notice, and any required changes to
`THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` or a local provenance file in the same pull request.
For direct dependencies, note the package name and license so maintainers can
audit redistribution and release-bundle obligations.

Permissive licenses such as Apache-2.0, MIT, MIT-0, BSD, ISC, and compatible
public-domain-equivalent grants are usually acceptable. GPL, AGPL, LGPL, SSPL,
source-available, custom commercial, or unclear licenses require explicit
maintainer approval before code, rules, fixtures, or adapted implementations are
merged.

## Security Reports

Do not include vulnerability details, exploit steps, credentials, or provider tokens in public issues. Use the process in `SECURITY.md` for suspected vulnerabilities.

## Community Standards

Keep discussion technical, specific, and respectful. The expected conduct for issues, pull requests, and maintainer decisions is documented in `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`.
