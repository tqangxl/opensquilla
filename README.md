## Overview

OpenSquilla is a token-efficient, microkernel AI agent. A local model
router sends each turn to the cheapest model that can handle it, while
persistent memory, a layered sandbox, built-in web search, and
on-device embeddings round out a single shared turn loop.

Every entry point — Web UI, CLI, and chat channels — runs through that
same loop, so tool dispatch, retries, and decision logging behave
identically everywhere. A pluggable provider layer speaks to
OpenRouter, OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, DeepSeek, Gemini, Qwen/DashScope,
and 20+ other LLM providers with no change to your code or config
schema.

OpenSquilla 0.3.1 is the current release.

For task-oriented product documentation, start with the
[OpenSquilla Product Guide](README.product.md) or the
[documentation index](docs/README.md).

## Installation

OpenSquilla runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux. Pick the path that
matches your use case.

Windows portable and Quick terminal install give you a prebuilt
**release** — no Git required. The other two — Install from source
and Develop from source — build **from a Git checkout** (`git clone` +
Git LFS).

Release install commands use published GitHub release assets. The
Windows portable zip also has a `/releases/latest/download/` alias for
the current release. Python wheel installs use versioned wheel filenames
because installers validate the version embedded in the wheel filename.

| Path | Audience | When to use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Windows portable](#windows-portable-no-python) | Windows users | No Python toolchain; one-zip launch |
| [Quick terminal install](#quick-terminal-install) **(recommended)** | End users on any OS | Release wheel from a terminal |
| [Install from source](#install-from-source) | Users tracking `main` | Run from a checkout, not edit it |
| [Develop from source](#develop-from-source) | Contributors | Edit, test, or debug the source |

### Prerequisites

| Requirement | Windows portable | Quick terminal install | Install from source | Develop from source |
| --- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Python 3.12+ | bundled | via `uv` | via `uv` or system | via `uv` |
| Git + Git LFS | — | — | required | required |
| `uv` | — | installed if missing | recommended | required |

The default `recommended` profile installs **SquillaRouter** —
OpenSquilla's on-device model router — and its model assets;
`OPENSQUILLA_INSTALL_PROFILE=core` omits those dependencies. The
separate `--router disabled` onboarding flag keeps the dependencies
installed but turns the router off at runtime.

On Windows, SquillaRouter's bundled ONNX runtime also needs the Visual
C++ runtime. The Windows portable launcher and the from-source
PowerShell installer install it automatically via `winget`; the
**Quick terminal install** (`uv tool install`) path does not — if
startup logs a `DLL load failed` error, install it manually (see
[Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)). OpenSquilla keeps running with
direct single-model routing until it is installed.

Install links: [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) ·
[Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com/) ·
[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

### Windows portable (no Python)

The fastest path on Windows — the zip ships a bundled CPython runtime,
so no separate Python install is required.

1. Download the current portable zip:
   <https://github.com/opensquilla/opensquilla/releases/latest/download/OpenSquilla-windows-x64-portable.zip>
2. Extract it to a writable folder such as Downloads or Documents,
   then right-click `Start OpenSquilla.cmd` and choose **Run as
   administrator**.
3. Complete the first-run setup, then open <http://127.0.0.1:18791/control/>.

> [!NOTE]
> Preview builds are unsigned; administrator launch is the supported
> path. If SmartScreen appears, choose **More info** → **Run anyway**.
> If Smart App Control or enterprise policy blocks the unsigned app,
> use [Quick terminal install](#quick-terminal-install) instead.

<details>
<summary>Advanced portable usage</summary>

Provide an OpenRouter key before first start:

```powershell
$env:OPENROUTER_API_KEY="sk-..."
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process Bypass
.\start.ps1
```

If `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` is set and no local config exists, the launcher
writes an env-reference config and starts the gateway without
prompting. If unset, the onboarding wizard lets you pick any supported
provider.

The portable zip does not install a global `opensquilla` command. For a
terminal where `opensquilla …` works, run `OpenSquilla Shell.cmd`, or
call the bundled launcher directly:

```powershell
.\opensquilla.cmd onboard --provider openrouter --api-key-env OPENROUTER_API_KEY
```

</details>

### Quick terminal install

The recommended path on Windows, macOS, and Linux. `uv` installs
OpenSquilla into its own isolated environment and manages its own
Python — no system Python required. This path installs published
releases only; for `main`, development branches, or local checkouts
use [Install from source](#install-from-source).

**1. Install `uv`** — skip if `uv --version` already works.

Linux / macOS:

```sh
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
. "$HOME/.local/bin/env"
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
$env:Path = "$env:USERPROFILE\.local\bin;" + $env:Path
```

**2. Install OpenSquilla** — the same command on every platform.

```sh
uv tool install --python 3.12 "opensquilla[recommended] @ https://github.com/opensquilla/opensquilla/releases/download/v0.3.1/opensquilla-0.3.1-py3-none-any.whl"
```

This installs the OpenSquilla wheel from the release URL, then lets
`uv` download the dependencies declared by the selected extras. The
default `recommended` extra includes SquillaRouter runtime dependencies
such as ONNX Runtime, LightGBM, NumPy, and tokenizers, so a first install
needs network access unless those wheels are already cached.

**3. Configure and run.**

```sh
opensquilla onboard
opensquilla gateway run
```

> [!NOTE]
> If `opensquilla` is not found right after a fresh `uv` install, open
> a new terminal, or re-run the PATH line from step 1.

For a fully pinned install, use the versioned wheel URL:
`https://github.com/opensquilla/opensquilla/releases/download/v0.3.1/opensquilla-0.3.1-py3-none-any.whl`.

### Install from source

Use this path to run OpenSquilla from a checkout without editing it.
The clone is only the package source for the installer; after install,
use the `opensquilla` command — do not run `uv run`. Choose
[Develop from source](#develop-from-source) instead if you intend to
modify the code.

1. **Clone with LFS assets**

   ```sh
   git lfs install
   git clone https://github.com/opensquilla/opensquilla.git
   cd opensquilla
   git lfs pull --include="src/opensquilla/squilla_router/models/**"
   ```

2. **Run the installer**

   **macOS / Linux**

   ```sh
   bash scripts/install_source.sh
   ```

   **Windows PowerShell**

   ```powershell
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File ./scripts/install_source.ps1
   ```

   The script installs `.[recommended]` (SquillaRouter + memory + local
   models) into a dedicated user environment via `uv tool install`,
   falling back to `python -m pip install --user` when `uv` is
   unavailable. Open a new terminal if `opensquilla` is not on `PATH`
   after install.

3. **(optional) Install advanced extras.** Most channels — Feishu,
   Telegram, DingTalk, QQ, WeCom, Slack, and Discord — work from the
   base install. The opt-in extras are:

   - `matrix` — Matrix channel (pulls in `matrix-nio`)
   - `matrix-e2e` — Matrix channel with end-to-end encryption (requires
     libolm)
   - `document-extras` — PDF generation via WeasyPrint

   ```sh
   OPENSQUILLA_INSTALL_EXTRAS=matrix bash scripts/install_source.sh        # macOS / Linux
   ```

   ```powershell
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File ./scripts/install_source.ps1 -Extras matrix   # Windows
   ```

4. **Configure and run** — see [Configuration](#configuration).

<details>
<summary>Install from source — terminal prerequisites and installer options</summary>

**Install prerequisites (Git, Git LFS, uv) from a terminal**

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
winget install --id Git.Git -e
winget install --id GitHub.GitLFS -e
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
git lfs install
```

macOS (Homebrew):

```sh
brew install git git-lfs uv
git lfs install
```

Debian / Ubuntu:

```sh
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y git git-lfs
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
git lfs install
```

On Fedora use `sudo dnf install -y git git-lfs`; on Arch use
`sudo pacman -S --needed git git-lfs`; then install `uv` with the
`curl` command above. PATH changes from these installers apply to new
terminal sessions.

**Installer environment variables and PATH checks**

```sh
OPENSQUILLA_INSTALL_PROFILE=core   bash scripts/install_source.sh   # minimal runtime, no SquillaRouter
OPENSQUILLA_INSTALL_DRY_RUN=1      bash scripts/install_source.sh   # print the plan only
```

Verify which `opensquilla` your shell runs with `command -v
opensquilla` (macOS/Linux) or `where.exe opensquilla` (Windows). If it
is not on `PATH`, run `uv tool update-shell`. After reinstalling from a
local checkout, restart the gateway so it loads the updated package.

</details>

### Develop from source

Use this path when you are working on OpenSquilla's source code:
making changes, running tests, or debugging behavior against this
checkout. It is not the normal install path. Unlike
[Install from source](#install-from-source), this path requires `uv`:
`uv sync` creates a repository-local `.venv`, and `uv run` executes
commands against the files in this checkout.

```sh
uv sync --extra recommended --extra dev
uv run opensquilla --help
```

The `recommended` extra includes SquillaRouter for development too;
the `dev` extra installs the test, lint, and typecheck tools. Install
additional extras into the same environment you run:

```sh
uv sync --extra recommended --extra dev --extra matrix
uv run opensquilla channels status matrix --json
```

In this mode, prefix every `opensquilla` command in
[Configuration](#configuration) with `uv run`. Do not debug a
development checkout through a user-local `opensquilla` command — that
command runs in a different Python environment.

#### Editable install into the tool environment

If you want the `opensquilla` command on `PATH` (so you can run it
without `uv run`) **and** have the executable track the current
checkout, use the dev-install wrapper instead of `uv sync`. The
wrapper runs `uv tool install -e ".[recommended]"` from the repo
root, so the `opensquilla` shim is editable, the SquillaRouter
runtime is pulled in, and you don't have to remember the PEP 508
extras form.

```sh
# macOS / Linux — default path for OpenSquilla contributors
bash scripts/dev-install.sh

# Windows PowerShell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/dev-install.ps1
```

Run the wrapper again after `git pull` to re-link the shim. Both
scripts forward extra arguments to `uv tool install`, e.g.
`bash scripts/dev-install.sh --no-cache`.

> **Why a wrapper instead of `uv tool install -e ".[recommended]"` directly?**
> `uv tool install` does not accept a `--extra` / `--all-extras` flag —
> it only takes `--with <pkg>` for individual packages — so the
> PEP 508 `.[recommended]` form is the only way to bring the runtime
> profile in from a one-liner. The wrapper centralises that so callers
> don't have to type it by hand. A bare `uv tool install -e .` will
> succeed but the gateway will start with "bundled ONNX router failed
> to load" and fall back to safe-routing mode.

---

## Configuration

### First-run setup

`opensquilla onboard` is the interactive first-run wizard. It writes
the active config file and keeps provider secrets in environment
variables when you pass `--api-key-env`. The router defaults to
`recommended` (SquillaRouter on supported providers); pass
`--router disabled` for direct single-model routing.

```sh
opensquilla onboard                # full interactive wizard
opensquilla onboard --if-needed    # idempotent: safe for scripts and re-installs
opensquilla onboard --minimal      # provider only; skip channels and search
opensquilla onboard status         # inspect every setup section without writing
```

In SSH, CI, or any environment without a TTY, use the non-interactive
form — keep the secret in the environment and pass its **name**, not
its value:

**Linux / macOS**

```sh
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="sk-..."
opensquilla onboard --provider openrouter --api-key-env OPENROUTER_API_KEY
```

**Windows PowerShell**

```powershell
$env:OPENROUTER_API_KEY="sk-..."
opensquilla onboard --provider openrouter --api-key-env OPENROUTER_API_KEY
```

OpenRouter is only an example — substitute any supported provider and
its API-key variable.

Re-configure one section later without redoing the whole wizard (these
examples assume the relevant API key is already in the environment):

```sh
opensquilla configure provider --provider openai --model gpt-4o --api-key-env OPENAI_API_KEY
opensquilla configure router --router recommended
opensquilla configure search   --search-provider brave --api-key-env BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY
opensquilla configure channels
```

Sections: `provider`, `router`, `channels`, `search`,
`image-generation`, `memory-embedding`. The Web UI exposes the same
catalog and status model at `/control/setup`: Provider and Router are
the fast path, while Channels, Search, Image generation, and Memory
embedding sit in the Capability Center and can be configured later.
Empty channels are treated as an opt-out, not a failed setup.

**Config load order:** `OPENSQUILLA_GATEWAY_CONFIG_PATH` →
`./opensquilla.toml` → `~/.opensquilla/config.toml` → built-in
defaults. Environment values for individual secrets always win over
file values.

### Migrate from OpenClaw or Hermes Agent

If you already have state under `~/.openclaw` or `~/.hermes`, run a
dry run first to inspect the migration report, then apply it explicitly:

```sh
opensquilla migrate openclaw --json
opensquilla migrate openclaw --apply

opensquilla migrate hermes --json
opensquilla migrate hermes --apply
```

Use `opensquilla migrate --source openclaw,hermes --apply` to import
both default homes. Add `--migrate-secrets` only after reviewing the dry-run
report. See [`MIGRATION.md`](MIGRATION.md) for custom paths and conflict
handling.

### Multi-instance profiles

Run several OpenSquilla agents on the same host without sharing locks,
sockets, or state files. Each profile gets its own `config.toml`,
`state/`, `logs/`, and `.env` under a common profiles root.

#### Default layout and automatic migration

The profiles root defaults to `$HOME/.opensquilla/profiles`, so the
default profile lives at `$HOME/.opensquilla/profiles/default/` and
named profiles (`--profile coder`) live at
`$HOME/.opensquilla/profiles/coder/` — siblings, not nested. Setting
`OPENSQUILLA_HOME=D:\ai\opensquilla\profiles` (or any other path)
gives the same flat layout under that directory.

```
~/.opensquilla/profiles/   ← OPENSQUILLA_HOME (or its default)
├── default/   ← OPENSQUILLA_PROFILE=default   (or flag omitted)
├── coder/     ← OPENSQUILLA_PROFILE=coder
└── agent-1/   ← OPENSQUILLA_PROFILE=agent-1
```

If you have an **existing** install under the legacy
`$HOME/.opensquilla/` home (the layout the pre-profiles releases
used), the very first CLI invocation after upgrading auto-migrates
the canonical subpaths (`state/`, `logs/`, `workspace/`, `media/`,
`config.toml`, `.env`) into `$HOME/.opensquilla/profiles/default/`
so the legacy install becomes the `default` profile with no operator
action required. The migration is one-time, atomic where possible,
and writes a `.migrated-to-profiles-root` sentinel inside the new
home so it never runs twice. Delete the sentinel to force a re-run.

The migration is intentionally conservative — anything not in the
canonical list (e.g. a `custom-stuff/` directory you created
yourself) is left in place under the legacy home.

#### Environment variables (Windows)

Two variables drive profile mode. Set both; `PROFILE` alone without
`PROFILES_DIR` is a no-op.

| Variable | Required? | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|
| `OPENSQUILLA_HOME` | yes (to enable) | `$HOME/.opensquilla/profiles` | Parent directory that contains every profile home. Setting this is the one switch that turns multi-instance mode on. |
| `OPENSQUILLA_PROFILE` | no | `default` | Name of the active profile. Must match `^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9_-]{0,63}$`. |
| `OPENSQUILLA_STATE_DIR` | no | _unset_ | **Full override** that bypasses profile mode entirely. Leave unset when running multiple profiles — it forces a single hard-coded home. |

**Permanent (per-user, survives reboot)**:

```powershell
# Required: enable multi-instance mode
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable(
    "OPENSQUILLA_HOME", "D:\ai\opensquilla\profiles", "User")

# Optional: pin this shell to a specific profile
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable(
    "OPENSQUILLA_PROFILE", "coder", "User")
```

Reopen PowerShell after `SetEnvironmentVariable` so the new value is
inherited by the process.

**Temporary (current session only)**:

```powershell
$env:OPENSQUILLA_HOME = "D:\ai\opensquilla\profiles"
$env:OPENSQUILLA_PROFILE      = "coder"     # omit to use "default"
opensquilla gateway start --port 18792
```

This is the right form for per-shell or per-task overrides, e.g. one
PowerShell window per profile with a different port.

**Verify**:

```powershell
echo $env:OPENSQUILLA_HOME
echo $env:OPENSQUILLA_PROFILE
# Expected:
#   D:\ai\opensquilla\profiles
#   coder    (or empty if you only set PROFILES_DIR)
```

**Resolution precedence** (see `src/opensquilla/paths.py`):

1. `OPENSQUILLA_STATE_DIR` — full override; bypasses profile mode. Do
   **not** set this when running multiple profiles.
2. `OPENSQUILLA_HOME` + `OPENSQUILLA_PROFILE` — multi-instance.
   Resolves to `<PROFILES_DIR>/<PROFILE>/`, e.g.
   `D:\ai\opensquilla\profiles\coder\`.
3. `$HOME/.opensquilla` — single-instance default (unchanged on disk
   for existing deployments).

#### Common patterns

| Scenario | What to set |
|---|---|
| Run a single `coder` instance | `OPENSQUILLA_HOME` permanent, `$env:OPENSQUILLA_PROFILE = "coder"` per shell |
| Run the `default` instance | `OPENSQUILLA_HOME` permanent, **omit** `OPENSQUILLA_PROFILE` (default is `default`) |
| Run `coder` + `agent-1` side by side | `OPENSQUILLA_HOME` permanent; open two PowerShells, each with its own `$env:OPENSQUILLA_PROFILE` and a different `--port` |
| Disable multi-instance for one command | `unset OPENSQUILLA_HOME` in that shell (or use `OPENSQUILLA_STATE_DIR=...` to pin a legacy home) |
| Bootstrap a new profile | `opensquilla --profile <name> init` — does not require any env var; the CLI's `--profile` flag wins over the env var |

#### macOS / Linux

The same two variables, set via the shell rc of choice:

```sh
# ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc
export OPENSQUILLA_HOME="$HOME/opensquilla/profiles"
# export OPENSQUILLA_PROFILE="coder"     # optional, defaults to "default"
```

#### Cross-platform path layout

Whichever OS you set `OPENSQUILLA_HOME` for, each profile lives as
a direct child of that root. The CLI uses `pathlib` for the join, so
backslashes, forward slashes, and tildes all work transparently.

```
D:\ai\opensquilla\profiles\         ← OPENSQUILLA_HOME (Windows)
├── default\    ← OPENSQUILLA_PROFILE=default   (or flag omitted)
├── coder\      ← OPENSQUILLA_PROFILE=coder
└── agent-1\    ← OPENSQUILLA_PROFILE=agent-1
```

```
/home/you/opensquilla/profiles/     ← OPENSQUILLA_HOME (Linux/macOS)
├── default/
├── coder/
└── agent-1/
```

#### Auto-start every profile at user logon (Windows)

The `scripts/supervisor/` PowerShell scripts wrap the CLI for
multi-profile lifecycle without touching core OpenSquilla code:

```powershell
# start every profile, in series, with stable per-profile port assignment
.\scripts\supervisor\start-all.ps1

# show one-row-per-profile status
.\scripts\supervisor\status.ps1

# stop them all
.\scripts\supervisor\stop-all.ps1

# register a logon task so the next Windows login auto-starts everything
.\scripts\supervisor\install-autostart.ps1

# remove the logon task
.\scripts\supervisor\uninstall-autostart.ps1
```

Per-profile port is `BasePort + sorted-index` (default 18791). Pass
`-BasePort` to shift the range. The supervisor scripts are thin wrappers:
they call `opensquilla --profile <name> gateway start/stop/status` for
each discovered subdirectory of the profiles root, so they pick up
configuration, health checks, and PID locking for free from the existing
CLI.

#### Profile name validation

Profile names must match `^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9_-]{0,63}$` to prevent
path-traversal escapes. The CLI rejects bad names up front with a clear
error. Valid examples: `default`, `coder`, `agent-1`, `dev_env`. Invalid
examples: `../escape`, `With Spaces`, `中文`, `a`×65.

### Run

```sh
opensquilla gateway run                # foreground, 127.0.0.1:18791
opensquilla gateway start --json       # background + health wait
opensquilla chat                       # interactive REPL
opensquilla agent -m "your prompt"     # one-shot, automation-friendly
```

Open the Web UI at <http://127.0.0.1:18791/control/>. The **Health**
view shows whether OpenSquilla is ready, what is not ready, and the
next recovery steps. From the CLI, run:

```sh
opensquilla doctor
opensquilla doctor --json
opensquilla doctor --config ./opensquilla.toml --json
```

`/health` and `/healthz` are lightweight liveness endpoints for process
checks. `opensquilla doctor` and the Web UI Health view are the readiness
surfaces for provider config, memory, logs, search, channels, sandbox
posture, router, image generation, and recovery guidance. Press
`Ctrl+C` to stop a foreground gateway.

Other command groups include `sessions`, `skills`, `memory`, `migrate`,
`cron`, `channels`, `providers`, `models`, and `cost`. Run
`opensquilla --help` or `opensquilla <group> --help` for details.

<details>
<summary>Advanced configuration — verify a channel, public network binding, Docker</summary>

**Connect and verify a messaging channel**

Channel saves are config changes, not runtime-connectivity proof.
Restart the gateway after channel edits, then verify the live channel:

```sh
opensquilla gateway restart
opensquilla channels status <name> --json
```

Treat a channel as connected only when the status payload reports
`enabled=true`, `configured=true`, and `connected=true`. Feishu
defaults to websocket mode, Telegram to polling, and Slack can use
Socket Mode — none of those modes needs a public URL. Feishu webhook
mode, Telegram webhook mode, Slack webhook mode, and WeCom require a
public, provider-reachable URL.

**Public network binding**

To reach the Web UI from another machine, bind the gateway to all
interfaces and use the host's public IP:

```sh
opensquilla gateway run --listen 0.0.0.0 --port 18791
```

Public access also requires the host firewall or cloud security group
to allow inbound TCP on that port. Do not expose the gateway with
`[auth] mode = "none"` — configure token auth before binding to
`0.0.0.0`.

**Docker**

The compose path runs an `opensquilla:local` image you build yourself.
Build it from a source checkout with the Git LFS router assets pulled
(see [Install from source](#install-from-source) for the clone and
`git lfs pull`):

```sh
docker build -t opensquilla:local .
```

`./start.sh` (or `start.ps1` on Windows) then runs `docker compose
up -d` and tails the gateway logs. Docker avoids a host Python
toolchain — not the local image build.

</details>

Provider tiers, sandbox tuning, image generation, and concurrency
settings live in `opensquilla.toml.example`.

## What's New in 0.3.1

OpenSquilla 0.3.1 is a maintenance release for the 0.3 line. It updates the
stable install metadata and brings selected channel, chat, provider, and
workflow fixes from the integration branch onto the stable release line:

- **Channel setup and replies** — Slack Socket Mode, app mentions, signing
  secrets, and threaded replies preserve the channel context needed for setup
  and replies.
- **Media and voice workflow handoffs** — short-drama/video helper workflows
  remain bundled, generated media flows have clearer review pauses, and
  voice/audio handoffs are usable end to end.
- **Chat formatting** — user message bubbles preserve multiline text and read
  like authored messages instead of compressed UI labels.
- **Provider request hardening** — malformed tool-call history is kept away
  from providers before it becomes invalid request state.
- **Install and release checks** — installer URLs, release metadata, version
  consistency tests, and CI impact gates are updated for 0.3.1.

Full notes: [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) ·
[`docs/releases/0.3.1.md`](docs/releases/0.3.1.md).

## What's New in 0.2.1

OpenSquilla 0.2.1 is a maintenance release focused on release-package
startup and long-running agent reliability:

- **Windows portable startup** — the portable launcher better detects and
  bootstraps the Visual C++ runtime needed by the bundled ONNX router.
- **Long-running agent turns** — tool-heavy WebUI sessions recover more
  cleanly from oversized tool results, malformed tool calls, artifact
  delivery handoffs, and degraded final responses.
- **Cleaner WebUI output** — generated artifact markers are kept out of
  normal chat replay while delivered files remain visible.
- **Memory recall scoring** — local and OpenAI-compatible embedding vectors
  are normalized before semantic search, and strong keyword matches remain
  usable when vector scores are low.

Full notes: [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) ·
[release notes](https://opensquilla.ai/news/).

## What's New in 0.2.0

This release expands OpenSquilla across migration, CLI chat, channels,
scheduling, and long-running tool work:

- **Migration path from existing agent homes** — `opensquilla migrate` previews
  and applies imports from existing OpenClaw/Hermes homes, including memory,
  persona files, skills, MCP/channel config, conflict handling, and migration
  reports.
- **Usable chat CLI** — `opensquilla chat` now has a persistent terminal UI,
  streaming output, queued input, slash-mode discovery, tool/status strips, and
  more deterministic live prompt behavior.
- **Cross-surface cron automation** — cron jobs now cover structured schedules,
  timezone-aware exact/every/cron runs, channel or webhook delivery, failure
  destinations, manual runs, and WebUI/CLI/RPC parity.
- **Better Feishu and Discord channels** — channel adapters expose clearer
  capability metadata, safer DM/group handling, native file and artifact paths,
  and improved attachment/thread behavior while privileged actions stay scoped.
- **Sturdier long-running turns** — failed turns are kept out of provider
  replay, malformed tool calls are handled more safely, and approval-gated
  retries wait for operator decisions.
- **Smarter context and tool budgeting** — provider-budget compaction, prompt
  cache preservation, bounded tool results, and side-effect-aware concurrency
  make large tool-heavy sessions more predictable.
- **Web UI and release polish** — recency ordering, table layout, mobile
  controls, duplicate notifications, setup forms, release URLs, and install
  paths are tightened for 0.2.0.

## Key Features

| Capability | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| **Token-efficient routing** | `SquillaRouter` — a local LightGBM + ONNX classifier in the `recommended` extra — scores each turn on length, language, code, keywords, and semantic embeddings, then routes it across four tiers (T0–T3) to the cheapest capable model. Classification runs on-device; your prompt never leaves the machine to make that decision. |
| **Adaptive reasoning and prompts** | OpenSquilla requests extended reasoning only for turns the router scores as complex, and the system prompt scales with task complexity — lightweight for trivial turns, full instructions for complex ones. |
| **20+ LLM providers** | The provider registry targets 20+ LLM backends — OpenRouter, OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, DeepSeek, Gemini, DashScope/Qwen, Moonshot, Mistral, Groq, Zhipu, SiliconFlow, vLLM, LM Studio, and more, with primary-plus-fallback selection; first-run onboarding exposes the verified subset. |
| **On-demand skills and MCP** | 15 bundled skills (coding, GitHub, cron, pptx/docx/xlsx/pdf, summarization, tmux, weather, and more) load only when the task needs them. OpenSquilla is an MCP client, and can also run as an MCP server — `opensquilla mcp-server run` needs the `mcp` extra (install `opensquilla[recommended,mcp]`). Skills can be authored, installed, and published from the CLI. |
| **Persistent local memory** | A curated `MEMORY.md` plus dated Markdown notes, searched with SQLite full-text keyword search and `sqlite-vec` semantic recall. Embeddings run on-device via bundled ONNX, or swap to OpenAI/Ollama. Optional exponential decay and opt-in "dream" consolidation are available. |
| **Layered security sandbox** | Three policy tiers (Standard / Strict / Locked) on a permission matrix. Bubblewrap isolates code execution on Linux; the macOS Seatbelt backend currently renders profiles only (execution pending), and there is no sandbox backend on Windows yet. A denial ledger auto-pauses autonomous runs after repeated denials, rejected outputs are purged, and skill metadata and tool results are XML-escaped against prompt injection. |
| **Built-in tools** | File read/write/edit, shell and background processes, git, web search (Brave or DuckDuckGo) and fetch behind an SSRF guard, spreadsheet/PPTX/PDF authoring, image generation, and text-to-speech. |
| **Unified gateway** | A Starlette ASGI server on `127.0.0.1:18791` with WebSocket RPC and an embedded control console (`/control/`). Web UI, CLI, and channels for Terminal, WebSocket, Slack, Telegram, Discord, Feishu, DingTalk, WeCom, Matrix, and QQ all share one `TurnRunner`. |
| **Durable sessions, subagents, and scheduling** | SQLite-backed session, transcript, and replay storage with per-agent workspaces. Agents spawn depth-bounded subagents, and a `SchedulerEngine` with an in-tree cron parser runs recurring jobs via `opensquilla cron`. |
| **Operator controls** | Human-in-the-loop approvals can pause sensitive tool calls for a decision; per-turn and per-session token and cost rollups (`opensquilla cost`) and diagnostics are available from the CLI and Web UI. |

## Benchmark Results

PinchBench 1.2.1 average results across 25 tasks:

| Agent | Base Model | Avg. score | Total input tokens | Total output tokens | Total cost |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| OpenSquilla | Model router (Opus4.7, GLM5.1, DS4 Flash) | 0.9251 | 1,721,328 | 61,475 | $0.688 |
| OpenClaw | Claude Opus 4.7 | 0.9255 | 3,066,243 | 50,890 | $6.233 |

Score is the mean across the 25 tasks; token counts and cost are
totals for the full run.

## Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary>Windows: <code>DLL load failed</code> / Visual C++ runtime</summary>

If startup logs `DLL load failed while importing
onnxruntime_pybind11_state`, OpenSquilla keeps running with direct
single-model routing, but the bundled `SquillaRouter` runtime stays
inactive until the Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio
2015–2022 (x64) is installed.

The Windows portable launcher and the from-source PowerShell installer
attempt to install the redistributable via `winget`. If you used Quick
terminal install, or `winget` is unavailable, install it manually and
restart PowerShell: <https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe>.
Then restore the recommended router:

```powershell
opensquilla onboard --provider openrouter --api-key-env OPENROUTER_API_KEY --router recommended
opensquilla gateway restart
```
