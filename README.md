## Overview

OpenSquilla is a token-efficient, microkernel AI agent — same budget,
more capability, better results. It combines smart routing, persistent
memory, a secure sandbox, built-in web search, and local embeddings
under a single model loop.
Every entry point — Web UI, CLI, and chat channels — runs through a
shared `TurnRunner`, and a pluggable provider layer lets it speak to
OpenRouter, OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, DeepSeek, Gemini, Qwen/DashScope,
and roughly twenty other LLM providers without changes to your code or
config schema.

## Quick start

The fastest path to a running OpenSquilla on your local machine.

1. Install prerequisites: [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.com/) and
   [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

2. Clone with LFS assets:

   ```sh
   git lfs install
   git clone https://github.com/opensquilla/opensquilla.git
   cd opensquilla
   git lfs pull --include="src/opensquilla/squilla_router/models/**"
   ```

3. Install with the recommended profile. This is the default profile and
   includes the bundled SquillaRouter runtime and model dependencies.

   macOS / Linux:

   ```sh
   bash install.sh
   ```

   Windows PowerShell:

   ```powershell
   pwsh -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File install.ps1
   ```

   Only set `OPENSQUILLA_INSTALL_PROFILE=core` if you intentionally want
   to skip the bundled router.

4. Configure (interactive wizard). Use the installed `opensquilla`
   command for the steps below; do not prefix these commands with
   `uv run` unless you are using the development install section.

   ```sh
   opensquilla onboard
   ```

5. Run the gateway:

   ```sh
   opensquilla gateway run
   ```

Open the Web UI at <http://127.0.0.1:18790/control/>.

## Advanced usage

A complete tutorial that covers every step in Quick start plus the
options Quick start glosses over. Sections marked **(optional)** can be
skipped depending on your environment; everything else is required for
a working install.

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.12+** — required for source and `uv` installs. **(optional)**
  for portable-zip users, since the release zip already bundles its own
  CPython.
- **Git and Git LFS** — required. The bundled SquillaRouter assets are
  stored as LFS pointers; without `git-lfs` the `recommended` profile
  fails with `version https://git-lfs.github.com/spec/v1` pointer files
  in place of the model bytes. Install once: <https://git-lfs.com/>.
- **`uv` or `pip` ≥ 23** — required. The installer scripts prefer
  `uv tool install` and fall back to `pip --user`. Install `uv` once:
  <https://docs.astral.sh/uv/>.

### Clone the repo

```sh
git lfs install
git clone https://github.com/opensquilla/opensquilla.git
cd opensquilla
git lfs pull --include="src/opensquilla/squilla_router/models/**"
```

### Install (user-local, recommended)

This is the normal install path for users. The scripts install
`.[recommended]` by default, which includes the bundled SquillaRouter
runtime dependencies. After this install, run `opensquilla ...`
directly.

The scripts prefer `uv tool install` and fall back to
`python -m pip install --user`. That installed CLI uses its own Python
environment; it is intentionally separate from a checkout-local `.venv`.
The post-install banner records a conventional user prefix and the
default loopback bind so you know where to look.

macOS / Linux:

```sh
bash install.sh
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
pwsh -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File install.ps1
```

**(optional)** Set `OPENSQUILLA_INSTALL_PROFILE=core` only if you want
the minimal runtime without the bundled router, or
`OPENSQUILLA_INSTALL_DRY_RUN=1` to print the plan without touching the
system.

### Install (for development) — optional

Use this only when you want commands to run from the current source
checkout. This creates a checkout-local `.venv`, separate from the
user-local `opensquilla` installed above.

```sh
uv sync --extra recommended
uv run opensquilla --help
```

In this mode prefix every `opensquilla ...` command below with `uv run`.
Do not mix this mode with the user-local install when debugging router
dependencies; they use different Python environments.

### First-run config

`opensquilla onboard` walks you through provider setup and (unless
skipped) channels and search, then writes a config file. The router
defaults to `recommended`, which enables SquillaRouter for supported
provider profiles. Pass `--router disabled` only if you intentionally
want direct single-model routing, or `--router openrouter-mix` to keep
the built-in OpenRouter mixed model routes. Useful invocations:

```sh
opensquilla onboard                # full interactive wizard
opensquilla onboard --if-needed    # idempotent: skip if already configured
opensquilla onboard --minimal      # provider only, skip channels/search
```

In SSH, CI, or any environment without a TTY the interactive flow
exits with code 2. Use the non-interactive form — keep the secret in
the environment and pass its **name**, not its value, to onboard:

```sh
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="sk-..."
opensquilla onboard \
  --provider openrouter \
  --model deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash \
  --api-key-env OPENROUTER_API_KEY
```

**(optional)** Re-configure one section later without redoing the whole
wizard:

```sh
opensquilla configure provider --provider openai --model gpt-4o
opensquilla configure search   --search-provider brave
opensquilla configure channels                # interactive section
```

Sections: `provider`, `router`, `channels`, `search`,
`image-generation`, `memory-embedding`. Onboarding is CLI-only — the
Web UI at `/control/` is the agent control console, not a setup
wizard.

**Config load order:** `OPENSQUILLA_GATEWAY_CONFIG_PATH` →
`./opensquilla.toml` → `~/.opensquilla/config.toml` → built-in
defaults. Onboarding writes the file at the path the runtime would
read; environment values for individual secrets always win over file
values.

### Run

```sh
opensquilla gateway run                   # foreground, 127.0.0.1:18790
opensquilla gateway start --json          # background + health wait
opensquilla chat                          # interactive REPL
opensquilla agent -m "your prompt"        # one-shot, automation-friendly
```

Open the Web UI at <http://127.0.0.1:18790/control/> and check health
with `curl http://127.0.0.1:18790/health`.

### Public network binding — (optional)

To make the Web UI reachable from another machine, bind the gateway to
all interfaces and use the host's public IP address:

```sh
opensquilla gateway run --listen 0.0.0.0 --port 18790
# or, for a background process:
opensquilla gateway start --listen 0.0.0.0 --port 18790 --json
```

Then open `http://<public-ip>:18790/control/` and verify the public
health endpoint with:

```sh
curl http://<public-ip>:18790/health
```

If another gateway is already bound to `18790`, stop it first or choose
a different `--port`. Public access also requires the host firewall or
cloud security group to allow inbound TCP traffic on that port.
Do not expose the gateway publicly with `[auth] mode = "none"`; configure
token or password auth before binding to `0.0.0.0`.

### Docker and portable paths — (optional)

`./start.sh` (or `start.ps1` on Windows) wraps `docker compose up -d`
and tails the gateway logs — convenient if you do not want a Python
toolchain on the host. Release zips that bundle a CPython runtime are
produced by the `Wheelhouse Zip Release` workflow; portable users
extract the zip and run its bundled launcher without a system Python
install.

### Further tuning

Provider-specific config, tier profiles, sandbox tuning, image
generation, and concurrency settings are managed through
`opensquilla onboard`, `opensquilla config`, and
`opensquilla.toml.example`.

## Benchmark Results

PinchBench 1.2.1 average results across 25 tasks:

| Agent | Base Model | Avg. score | Total input tokens | Total output tokens | Total cost |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| OpenSquilla | Model router (Opus4.7, GLM5.1, DS4 Flash) | 0.9251 | 1,721,328 | 61,475 | $0.688 |

## Key Features

- **Token-efficient routing** — local `SquillaRouter` (LightGBM + ONNX
  BGE classifier, `recommended` extra) routes each turn across four
  tiers (T0–T3). Hybrid features (length, language, code blocks,
  keywords + semantic embeddings) pick the cheapest model that can
  handle the turn; classification runs on-device, so your prompt never
  leaves the machine to make the decision.
- **Adaptive reasoning and prompts** — reasoning-token billing only
  kicks in when the turn needs deep thought, and the system prompt
  scales with task complexity (lightweight for trivial turns, full
  instructions for complex ones). No paying reasoning tokens for "hello".
- **On-demand skills** — built-in MCP client plus 16
  bundled skills (coding agents, GitHub, cron, deep research,
  pptx/docx/xlsx/pdf toolkits, summarization, tmux, weather, and more);
  only the skills needed for the current task are loaded into context,
  avoiding steady-state token waste.
- **Four-tier cognitive memory** — working (current task) → episodic
  (experience and causality) → semantic (facts and rules) → raw (audit
  and retraining base), mirroring human cognition.
- **Hybrid memory search + local embeddings** — Markdown source-of-truth
  memory with FTS keyword search alongside `sqlite-vec` semantic recall.
  Bundled ONNX inference runs on CPU so embeddings stay on your machine;
  optionally swap to OpenAI- or Ollama-hosted embeddings.
- **Adaptive recall and consolidation** — frequently used memories
  auto-promote and dated ones decay exponentially (with an "evergreen"
  opt-out); periodic Dream consolidation merges scattered episodic
  traces into structured knowledge, mirroring sleep consolidation, with
  bounded prompt-injection budgets throughout.
- **Layered security sandbox** — three policy tiers (Standard / Strict
  / Locked) on a permission-tier matrix, with Bubblewrap on Linux
  executing code in isolated environments (the macOS Seatbelt backend
  currently renders SBPL profiles only; process execution is pending).
  A denial ledger auto-pauses autonomous execution after repeated
  sandbox denials, rejected outputs are purged via intent + stale-output
  caches so the agent can't recover them through a side channel, and
  all skill metadata and tool results are XML-escaped to close common
  prompt-injection vectors.
- **Unified gateway across all entry points** — Starlette ASGI server on
  `127.0.0.1:18790` with WebSocket RPC and an embedded control console
  (`/control/`). Web UI, CLI, and first-class adapters for Terminal,
  WebSocket, Slack, Telegram, Discord, Feishu, DingTalk, WeCom, MS
  Teams, Matrix, and QQ all converge on a shared `TurnRunner` for
  consistent tool dispatch, retry, and decision logging.
- **20+ LLM providers** — OpenRouter, OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama,
  DeepSeek, Gemini, DashScope/Qwen, Moonshot, Mistral, Groq, Zhipu,
  SiliconFlow, Volcengine, BytePlus, MiniMax, vLLM, LM Studio, OVMS, and
  more, with a primary-plus-fallback selector.
- **Durable sessions, agents, and scheduling** — SQLite-backed session,
  transcript, and replay storage with per-agent workspaces and a
  `reset`/flush contract that proves persistence before destructive
  rewrites; `SchedulerEngine` with an in-tree `CronExpression` parser
  plus stagger, reaper, and heartbeat services exposed via the
  `opensquilla cron` CLI.
